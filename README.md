# a__serverClient

This project's target was to understand how does a server-client model works. The code is really simple, without "try-except" loops, because I just wanted to transfer the logic and the way of thinking around this section. Of course more can be implemented.

Purpose: understanding the role of a server and a client

Target: start a message between server-client and see how does it works

Program.Lang: Python3.6+

Packages: socket, time, Decimal
